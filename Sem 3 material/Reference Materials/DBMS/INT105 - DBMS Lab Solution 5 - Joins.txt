1.Give an example for a Cartesian join
  select * from pc,printer;
2.Give an example for a Cartesian join involving 3 tables.
  select * from pc,laptop,printer;
3.List the name, age, skill from the worker and worker skill tables for workers whose age is greater than 30 (use equi join).
 select a.name,a.age,b.skill from worker a,workerskill b where a.age>30 and a.name=b.name;
4.Give an example for a non-equi join.
select b.name,a.age,b.skill from worker a,workerskill b where a.age>35 and a.name<>b.name;
5.List the distinct combinations of PC models whose HD capacities are same (use self join).
6.Display the manufacturers of PC along with the details model, price (use inner join)
  select a.maker,b.model_no,b.price from product_info a, pc b where a.model_no=b.model_no;
7.List the laptop and pc pairs whose price is same (list the model numbers, use inner join).
select a.model_no,b.model_no from pc1 a,laptop b where a.price=b.price;
8.Give an example for left outer, right outer and full outer joins.
  LEFT OUTER JOIN
  	select a.name,a.age,b.skill from worker a,workerskill b where a.name=b.name(+);
    select w.name,w.age,ws.skill from worker w left outer join workerskill ws on w.name=ws.name;
  RIGHT OUTER JOIN
	select a.name,a.age,b.skill from worker a,workerskill b where a.name(+)=b.name;
	select w.name,w.age,ws.skill from worker w right outer join workerskill ws on w.name=ws.name;
  FULL OUTER JOIN
	select a.name,a.age,b.skill from worker a,workerskill b where a.name=b.name(+) union select a.name,a.age,b.skill 
	from worker a,workerskill b where a.name=b.name(+);
9.Give an example of how NVL function can be used effectively in outer joins.
	select a.name,a.age,NVL(b.name,'NULL') as name from worker a, workerskill b where a.name=b.name(+);
	select NVL(a.name,'NULL') as name,a.age,b.name from worker a,workerskill b where a.name (+)=b.name;
